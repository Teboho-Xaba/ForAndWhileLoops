# ForAndWhileLoops

This was an exercise to remind myself of Javascript loops, specifically the For and While loops.

As I already have a substancial grasp on most basic Javascript concepts, it seems right to move onto advanced ES6+ Javascript and the subsequent concepts while finding and doing projects for practice. The goal is to have 200+ projects by end of year (24 days henceforth) and begin with React, Node, MongoDB and Express. I say this as I have already started with Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap, what's only missing are the projects which will follow shortly.
